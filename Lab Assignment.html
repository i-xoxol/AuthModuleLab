        <h1>Secure Development Lab (CY-410)</h1>
        <h2>Software and System Security - Sacred Heart University, Fairfield, CT</h2>

        <div style="text-align: left;">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                Welcome to the Secure Development Lab! This lab is designed to provide you with hands-on experience in building a secure web application with a focus on authentication. You will explore the principles of secure software development, understand the importance of unit testing in minimizing vulnerabilities, and learn about the architecture of a secure authentication module.
            </p>

            <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Understand the core principles of secure software development.</li>
                <li>Learn how to design and implement a secure authentication module.</li>
                <li>Appreciate the role of unit tests in identifying and mitigating security risks.</li>
                <li>Understand how different components of an application work together to provide a secure user experience.</li>
                <li>Apply the concepts of the CIA triad (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) to a real-world application.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The CIA Triad and Secure Software Development</h2>
            <p>
                The CIA triad is a fundamental model in information security that helps in the design and evaluation of security policies. It consists of three core principles:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Confidentiality:</strong> Ensuring that sensitive information is not disclosed to unauthorized individuals. In this lab, confidentiality is achieved by hashing passwords and protecting user data.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Maintaining the consistency, accuracy, and trustworthiness of data over its entire lifecycle. In this lab, integrity is maintained by ensuring that only authorized users can modify their data (which is not implemented, but you can think about how you would do it) and by using cryptographic hashes to protect passwords from modification.</li>
                <li><strong>Availability:</strong> Ensuring that information is available when it is needed. In this lab, availability is ensured by having a functional application that allows users to register, log in, and access their profiles.
            </ul>

            <h2>Lab Architecture</h2>
            <p>
                This lab is composed of several components that work together to provide a secure authentication system. Understanding the role of each component is crucial for understanding the overall security of the application.
            </p>

            <h3>Back-End Components (Python)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>`api.py`:</strong> This is the main entry point of our web application. It uses the Flask framework to create a web server and define the API endpoints for handling login, registration, logout, and profile access. It also manages user sessions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>`auth.py`:</strong> This module contains the core authentication logic. It provides functions for hashing passwords, comparing passwords, and managing user data in the `usersdb.json` file. This separation of concerns is important for maintainability and security.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>`user.py`:</strong> This module defines the `User` class, which represents a user in our system. It is a simple data structure that holds the username, hashed password, and salt.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>`user_registration.py`:</strong> This module handles the user registration process. It uses functions from `auth.py` to create new users and save them to the database.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>`usersdb.json`:</strong> This is a simple JSON file that acts as our user database. In a real-world application, you would use a more robust database system like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Front-End Components (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>`index.html`, `login.html`, `register.html`:</strong> These are the HTML files that define the structure of our web pages.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>`style.css`:</strong> This file contains the CSS code for styling the web pages, making them visually appealing and user-friendly.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>`script.js`, `register.js`:</strong> These JavaScript files contain the logic for handling user interactions on the front-end, such as form submissions and communication with the back-end API.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Testing Components (Python)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>`test_auth.py`, `test_user_registration.py`, `test_api.py`:</strong> These files contain the unit tests for our application. Unit tests are crucial for ensuring the correctness and security of our code. They help us to automatically verify that our functions and endpoints behave as expected and to catch any regressions or vulnerabilities that might be introduced during development.
                </li>
            </ul>
